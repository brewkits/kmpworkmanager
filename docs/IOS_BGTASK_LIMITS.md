# iOS Background Task — Hard Limits

> **TL;DR.** iOS `BGTaskScheduler` is **opportunistic**, **time-bounded**, and
> **headless**. No library — including this one — can break these limits. They
> are enforced by `kernel_task` and `dasd` (Duet Activity Scheduler Daemon),
> not by Swift code. Plan your feature around them or it will fail in

This doc captures the four hard limits we keep seeing teams hit. Each section
states the limit, what it actually feels like in production, and how to design
around it.

---

## 1. Scheduling is opportunistic ("the BGTask black box")

### What's actually happening

When you call `BGTaskScheduler.submit(BGAppRefreshTaskRequest)`, iOS does **not**
schedule a wakeup at `earliestBeginDate`. It enqueues a *hint* — the actual
decision of whether to wake the app is made by **`dasd`** (Duet Activity
Scheduler Daemon), an on-device system service whose inputs are:

- App usage patterns (Siri prediction model) — how often the user opens this app
  at this hour of day, on this Wi-Fi network, with the phone in this orientation.
- Battery level + charging state. Below ~20 % battery, BGTask requests are
  silently dropped.
- Low Power Mode — drops **all** BGTask requests, no fallback.
- Thermal state — `ProcessInfo.processInfo.thermalState >= .serious` drops
  BGTasks.
- Cellular vs Wi-Fi for `BGProcessingTaskRequest.requiresNetworkConnectivity`.
- Whether the user has Background App Refresh enabled (Settings → General →
  Background App Refresh) — globally and per-app.

`earliestBeginDate` is a **hint**, not a guarantee. Apple documents this as
"the system runs tasks at times that minimise the impact on the user", which in
practice means **the task may never run**.

### What this feels like in production

- Apps that prompt the user once a week run reliably.
- Apps that prompt the user every 2-3 days run "usually".
- Apps the user installed and forgot about — task is **never** scheduled.
  The lower the engagement, the lower `dasd`'s priority weight.
- Power-user phones with 200+ apps installed: `dasd` rotates BGTask slots
  across all eligible apps. You compete with every other backgrounded app
  for a fixed daily budget.

### Do NOT use BGTask for

- 🚫 **Alarms / reminders** — `BGAppRefreshTaskRequest` will not fire on time,
  ever. Use `UNUserNotificationCenter.add(_:)` with a `UNTimeIntervalTrigger`
  or `UNCalendarNotificationTrigger`.
- 🚫 **Real-time sync** ("messages should arrive within 10 seconds") — use
  silent pushes (`content-available: 1`) with `application(_:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler:)`,
  not BGTask.
- 🚫 **Anything the user expects to "just happen" by a specific time** — the
  contract iOS gives you is "maybe, eventually, when convenient for the OS".

### DO use BGTask for

- ✅ Camera-roll backup that the user is OK happening "overnight or whenever"
  the phone is charging on Wi-Fi.
- ✅ Pre-fetching content (article cache, image thumbnails) for the next time
  the user opens the app.
- ✅ Cleanup tasks (log rotation, expired-cache eviction) that have no SLA.
- ✅ Best-effort upload of analytics / telemetry batches.

### Library guarantees

`KmpWorkManager` on iOS:

- ✅ Persists scheduled tasks to disk so they survive process death and reboot.
- ✅ Re-submits the BGTask request after the task completes, after a reboot,
  and after the first cold-launch following app install.
- ❌ Cannot make iOS wake the app on a deterministic schedule. **Nothing can.**

## 2. Time budget exhaustion (`0x8badf00d` SIGKILL)

### What's actually happening

Each BGTask wake gives the app a wall-clock execution window:

| Task type | Budget | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `BGAppRefreshTask` | ~30 seconds | Hard ceiling, no extension API |
| `BGProcessingTask` | Several minutes (typically 1–10 min) | iOS adjusts dynamically based on battery + thermal state |
| Silent push (`content-available`) | ~30 seconds | Same as App Refresh |

When the budget runs out:

1. iOS calls your `task.expirationHandler` (if set). You have **a few hundred
   milliseconds** to clean up.
2. If the expiration handler doesn't return in time, the OS sends `SIGKILL`
   with exception code `0x8badf00d` ("ate bad food"). Your process is gone —
   `finally` blocks may or may not run, file writes in progress are corrupted.
3. iOS records the kill against your app's reliability score, which reduces
   `dasd`'s willingness to wake you next time. **Repeated 0x8badf00d kills
   shadowban your app from background execution.**

### What this feels like in production

- A video transcoding task that takes 45 s on the latest iPhone Pro runs
  cleanly. The same task on an iPhone XR with a hot battery gets killed at 20 s
  → file partial, never finalised.
- An upload chain with 50 photos averaging 800 ms each = 40 s. Works on Wi-Fi;
  fails on cellular (slower per-photo) because 50 × 1.2 s = 60 s exceeds the
  `BGAppRefreshTask` ceiling.

### Design rules

1. **Each step in a chain MUST finish in ≤ 5 seconds.**
   Long-running work should be split into many granular steps; the
   `ChainExecutor` checkpoints after every step, so a kill mid-chain resumes
   from the last completed step.
2. **Never `runBlocking`** on a coroutine that calls network I/O. Always
   `withTimeout(5_000)` around individual operations.
3. **Use `BGProcessingTaskRequest` (not `BGAppRefreshTaskRequest`)** for any
   workload over 10 s. The processing-task budget is much larger and the
   API accepts `requiresExternalPower = true` to prefer charging time.
4. **Implement `expirationHandler` for every task you submit** — even if it
   just calls `chainExecutor.cancelAndPersist()`. Without it the OS gives you
   a hard SIGKILL with no cleanup.

### Library guarantees

`KmpWorkManager` on iOS:

- ✅ Checkpoints `ChainProgress` after every step. Re-launch resumes from the
  last completed step, not from scratch.
- ✅ Wires `task.expirationHandler` to cancel the chain coroutine + flush
  progress to disk (best-effort within the ~hundreds-of-ms window).
- ✅ Emits `withTimeout` around `doAlarmWork` on Android with a default 8 s
  budget; on iOS each step in `ChainExecutor` is bounded.
- ❌ Cannot prevent `0x8badf00d` if your step itself blocks > 5 s. Split the
  step.

### Diagnosing `0x8badf00d`

Xcode → Window → Devices → View Device Logs → filter `<process>: <0x8badf00d>`.
Each entry includes the stack at kill time. Common patterns:

- Stack in `CFNetwork` → upload hung past the budget; add per-request timeout.
- Stack in `dispatch_semaphore_wait` → coroutine blocked on a `runBlocking`;
  refactor to suspend.
- Stack in your `expirationHandler` → handler itself is too slow; pre-build
  the cleanup work, don't allocate inside the handler.

## 3. Headless DI cold-start

### What's actually happening

When iOS wakes your app for a BGTask:

1. Process starts with `UIApplication.shared.applicationState == .background`.
2. `AppDelegate.application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)` runs **with
   `launchOptions[.bluetoothCentrals] == nil`** — the OS doesn't tell you the
   wake reason. You may not even know you're in a BGTask context until later.
3. **No UI is created.** `UIWindow`, `UIScene`, view controllers — none of
   it. The app is "headless".
4. iOS expects `didFinishLaunching` to return quickly (~10 s). After that
   point, BGTask budget starts ticking against you.
5. If your DI graph (Koin module loading, Realm/SQLite init, Firebase config
   fetch) takes 8 s to initialise, you only have ~30 - 8 = 22 s of actual
   work budget left for the `BGAppRefreshTask`.

### What this feels like in production

- Production app with 40 Koin modules, all eager — cold-start to first useful
  work = 6.5 s on iPhone 11. On a `BGAppRefreshTask` that's already 22 % of
  your budget gone before the worker even starts.
- Firebase Remote Config blocking init for 4 s on cellular — task budget
  drains before any I/O happens.
- A `RealmConfiguration.defaultConfiguration` that triggers a migration —
  multi-second pause before the first DB query.

### Design rules

1. **Lazy-init everything not needed for BGTask.** UI theme manager,
   analytics SDK, third-party crash reporter — these have no business
   loading during a `BGAppRefreshTask`. Initialise them in
   `applicationDidBecomeActive` instead of `didFinishLaunching`.
2. **Detect BGTask context early.** A typical pattern:

   ```swift
   func application(
       _ application: UIApplication,
       didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?
   ) -> Bool {
       let isHeadless = application.applicationState == .background
       AppContainer.bootstrap(headless: isHeadless)  // skip UI / analytics deps
       BGTaskScheduler.shared.register(forTaskWithIdentifier: "com.app.refresh", using: nil) { task in
           Task { await handleRefresh(task) }
       }
       return true
   }
   ```
3. **Measure cold-start.** Add a `os_signpost` around your DI bootstrap and
   audit it on a real device, not the simulator. Simulator cold-start is
   ~5× faster than a 4-year-old iPhone in Low Power Mode.
4. **Never trigger network I/O during DI init.** Firebase Remote Config,
   feature-flag fetches, etc. should be background tasks of their own, not
   blocking dependencies of the DI graph.

### Library guarantees

`KmpWorkManager` on iOS:

- ✅ Koin module registration is small (one module, ~5 ms on iPhone 11). The
  library itself does not bloat your cold-start.
- ✅ `KmpWorkManager.initialize()` is idempotent and safe to call inside the
  BGTask handler if you want to defer it past `didFinishLaunching`.
- ❌ Cannot speed up your host app's DI graph. Audit your own bootstrap path.

## 4. ZIP codec absence (Kotlin/Native limitation)

### What's actually happening

Kotlin/Native does not ship a ZIP codec. The JVM has `java.util.zip`,
Kotlin/Native does not. `FileCompressionWorker.ios.kt` historically worked
around this by **silently copying the file uncompressed** — the worker
returned `Success`, the host app shipped an 80 MB "compressed" RAW upload to
the server, no one noticed until the bill arrived.

### Current behaviour (v2.5)

`FileCompressionConfig.allowIosUncompressedFallback`:

- `false` (default) — `FileCompressionWorker.ios` returns `WorkerResult.Failure`
  with an actionable message. The app must handle the failure explicitly.
- `true` — opt-in copy fallback (the pre-v2.5 behaviour, but now explicit).

This is a correctness-vs-convenience trade-off; the default favours
correctness.

### Future direction (v2.6+)

The Apple SDK exposes ZIP via:

- `Compression` framework (`compression_encode_buffer` / `compression_decode_buffer`)
  — fast, in-memory, but block-based; not a streaming ZIP format. Good for
  per-file LZMA/Brotli compression inside a tarball, not a ZIP archive.
- `Foundation`'s undocumented `_NSZipArchive` — private API, App Store
  rejection risk.
- Third-party Swift packages (ZIPFoundation, SSZipArchive) — usable but
  require adding a Swift dependency to the iOS host and exposing it via
  Kotlin/Native cinterop.

The plan documented in `ROADMAP.md` v2.6 is **cinterop to `libz` (zlib)**
which is part of the iOS SDK at `/usr/lib/libz.dylib`, plus a small Kotlin
wrapper that emits ZIP file format (local file headers + central directory +
end-of-central-directory record). zlib's `deflate` handles the compressed
payload; the ZIP container is ~150 lines of byte-pushing code.

Until this lands, **camera apps that need real compression on iOS** should:

1. Set `allowIosUncompressedFallback = false` (the default).
2. Handle the failure by either:
   - Implementing compression in Swift host code (using ZIPFoundation in
     your app), and invoking the KMP chain only for the upload step, OR
   - Skipping compression on iOS and uploading uncompressed (often
     acceptable for already-compressed media like H.264 video / JPEG).

### Library guarantees

`KmpWorkManager` on iOS:

- ✅ `FileCompressionWorker.ios` fails fast by default — no silent corruption.
- ⏳ Real ZIP via zlib cinterop tracked in v2.6 roadmap.
- ❌ Cannot use `java.util.zip` on iOS. K/N has no JVM stdlib.

## 5. Exact alarms on iOS need a user action to "catch up"

**The reality.** Unlike Android's `AlarmManager.setExactAndAllowWhileIdle` (which the
OS fires even when the app is fully closed), **iOS has no equivalent primitive**.
The closest iOS offers are:

- `UNUserNotificationCenter` local notifications — fire on time but only show a
  banner; do not run your code unless the user taps the notification.
- `BGTaskScheduler` — opportunistic, no guaranteed timing (see §1).

`NativeTaskScheduler.checkAndExecuteMissedExactAlarms()` is the library's
"catch-up" pattern: when the user opens the app via `applicationDidBecomeActive`,
the library scans persisted exact-alarm metadata and runs any that should have
fired by now. If the user never opens the app, **the task waits indefinitely**.

### DO NOT use exact alarms on iOS for

- 🚫 **Alarm clocks / wake-up apps** — the user expects sound at 7 AM whether or
  not they've opened your app this week.
- 🚫 **Medication / prescription reminders** — same reason.
- 🚫 **Trading / financial transaction triggers** — "execute at 3 PM" cannot be
  guaranteed by an iOS client. Use a server-side scheduler.
- 🚫 **Time-locked content unlock / expiring invitations** — anything where
  missing the time window has irreversible cost.

### What exact alarms ARE good for on iOS

- ✅ "Sync drafts when the app opens after 2 AM" — opportunistic work the user
  is expected to open the app for anyway.
- ✅ "Show a 'long time no see' nudge the next time the user opens the app and
  it's been > 7 days."
- ✅ Best-effort triggers where missing one occurrence is fine and the next user
  visit will catch up.

### Library guarantees

`KmpWorkManager` on iOS:

- ✅ Persists exact-alarm metadata so `checkAndExecuteMissedExactAlarms()` can
  catch up on next launch.
- ✅ Tries opportunistic `BGTaskScheduler` paths in parallel so a lucky wake
  may fire the alarm without a foreground visit.
- ❌ Cannot wake the app at an exact time without a user-initiated action or
  silent push. **Nothing on iOS can.**

## Summary table

| Limit | Hard ceiling | Library can mitigate? | Workaround |
|---|---|---|---|
| Opportunistic scheduling | OS decides, not us | No | Don't use BGTask for alarms / realtime; use `UNUserNotification` / silent push |
| Time budget | ~30 s App Refresh, few min Processing | Partial (checkpointing, expirationHandler) | Granular steps ≤ 5 s; prefer `BGProcessingTaskRequest` |
| Headless DI cold-start | ~10 s before budget starts ticking | No | Lazy-init non-BGTask deps; measure cold-start on real devices |
| No ZIP codec | K/N stdlib gap | Yes (fail-fast default) | Use Swift host for compression, or wait for v2.6 zlib cinterop |
| Exact alarms need user action | iOS has no "wake at time T and run code" primitive | Partial (catch-up on app open) | Use `UNUserNotification` for user-visible alarms; server-side scheduler for SLA-critical timing |

---

## When in doubt

> "If your feature breaks when iOS decides not to wake the app, your feature
> should not have been a BGTask in the first place."

For deterministic schedules — alarms, exam reminders, prayer-time
notifications, scheduled-message delivery — use `UNUserNotificationCenter`.
The notification fires at the scheduled time without your app running at all;
iOS handles it. When the user taps the notification, your app opens and you
can do real work then.

Use BGTask for *opportunistic, best-effort* work where "eventually" is good
enough.
